# Evals that discriminate

Locator: `odd/tasks/evals.md` · Engram mirror: `odd/evals/tasks` · Branch: `feat/evals`

## Goal
A set of eval tasks on which the minimal and the current Claude Code configurations score
measurably apart, and one A/B run of both at `medium` and `high` effort, so "does this piece of
the harness help?" is answered by data instead of opinion.

## Why
Principle 2 of the roadmap: every component must earn its place, and F7's future-model protocol
strips one component at a time and measures. That only works with evals that can tell configs
apart. The predecessor's 32 tasks could not: the bare config scored 94%, 30 of 32 tasks sat at
their maximum, and even the tasks written to be hard hit the ceiling
(`D:\harness\PLAN.md:661`, `:1055`, `:1549`). Its graders were text rubrics over the answer; its
own list of untested ground was long-horizon, multi-file work. This phase goes there, and grades
by hidden tests, so a score is a command's exit, not a phrasing match.

## Done when
- `npm run check` exits 0
- `node bin/js-harness.mjs contract check odd/tasks/evals.md` exits 0
- `node --test "evals/**/*.test.mjs"` exits 0
- `node evals/report.mjs --require-complete --min-discriminating 3` exits 0
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` records the A/B result (per task and effort: both configs' mean score, spread,
  tokens and wall time) and `node bin/js-harness.mjs progress` shows F5's three steps checked

## In scope / Out of scope
- In: a new `evals/` folder (runner, tasks, fixtures, hidden graders, committed result
  summaries, report), `package.json` scripts, `.gitignore` for raw run output, `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Out: the published package (`files` stays `bin/` and `AGENTS.md`: evals measure the harness,
  users do not run them); Codex (F6); changing the stack under test to make a config win (the
  run measures what is installed); the predecessor's code (mined for lessons, rewritten here).

## Constraints
- No USD ceiling (Sebastián, 2026-09-30). Runs use the flat-rate subscription, so the real limits
  are tokens, wall time and the plan's usage cap — because the predecessor hit that cap twice in
  one week and lost 141 trials to it (`D:\harness\HANDOFF.md:22`). The runner therefore records
  tokens and time per trial, stops cleanly on a cap or auth error instead of recording zeros,
  and resumes by skipping trials already recorded.
- The current config must not write into Sebastián's real engram store, `~/.claude/projects`, or
  gentle-ai state — because eval runs would pollute the memory and history his daily work reads.
  Isolation is proven by a test or a captured run before the A/B run, not assumed.
- Auto-update and auto-memory are off during runs — because a mid-run CLI update and a leaked
  `MEMORY.md` each corrupted a predecessor run (`D:\harness` findings, 2026-08-08).
- Workspaces live in a throwaway directory and are removed after grading — because the
  predecessor's suite leaked 16,326 temp entries.
- A task's grader is hidden from the agent: it is copied in only after the agent exits — because
  a visible grader turns the task into "make these tests pass" and measures nothing else.
- Zero dependencies in the runner and graders — because every command in this repo runs with no
  install step (AGENTS.md, "How the repo works").
- "Discriminates" keeps the predecessor's definition — the two configs' mean scores on a task
  differ by more than the pooled within-config standard deviation — so its "0 of 32" and this
  phase's result are comparable.

## Effort
high

## Ask me before
Lowering the discrimination bar (`--min-discriminating 3`) or changing its definition; running
on Codex (that is F6); anything that would write into the real `~/.claude`, engram or gentle-ai
state.

## TDD
Mode: strict (source: user global config). Runner: `node --test`.

## Delivery
Forecast: ~900–1,300 authored lines (runner and report with tests ~500, task fixtures and hidden
graders ~400–700, docs), above the ~400 slice budget. Strategy: `ask-on-risk`; chain strategy
`stacked-to-main`, reusing Sebastián's choice for the earlier features: each slice its own PR
against `main`, merged in order. Slices: 1 = T1–T2, 2 = T3–T4, 3 = T5–T6.

## Design
- Configs, both on `claude-opus-5-5` through `claude --print --output-format json`, prompt on
  stdin, one fresh workspace per trial:
  - **minimal**: `--setting-sources ""`, `--strict-mcp-config`, `--disable-slash-commands`: no
    user settings, no global `CLAUDE.md`, no MCP servers, no hooks, no skills. The model and the
    built-in tools, nothing else.
  - **current**: the machine's real Claude Code setup as Sebastián works daily (user settings,
    global `CLAUDE.md` with the gentle-ai block, MCP servers, hooks, skills), with the workspace
    initialized by `js-harness init` so the project layer is present too; its writes redirected
    as the Constraints require.
  - Effort by `--effort medium|high`, the only flag that differs between the two effort arms.
- A task is `evals/tasks/<id>/`: `task.md` (the prompt, verbatim), `fixture/` (the repo the agent
  starts in), `grader/` (hidden tests) and `task.json` (grader command, timeout). The score is the
  fraction of hidden tests that pass, 0–1, which gives more resolution than pass/fail.
- A trial record holds config, effort, task, repeat, score, input and output tokens, turns, wall
  time, CLI version and error; raw transcripts go to gitignored `evals/runs/`, summaries to
  committed `evals/results/`.
- Headroom screen before the A/B run: a candidate task is kept only if the minimal config at
  `medium` scores a mean below 0.8 over 3 trials — the predecessor's lesson is that a task
  nobody fails cannot separate anyone.
- The A/B run: 2 configs × 2 efforts × the kept tasks × 3 repeats.

## Tasks
- [ ] T1 Runner: one trial end to end against a fake agent command — workspace, prompt on stdin,
  hidden grader copied in after exit, score, record, cleanup, resume, stop on cap (route:
  delegated writer — runner and its tests are two non-trivial files)
- [ ] T2 Configs: minimal and current as runner inputs, with the current config's isolation
  proven (engram, projects, gentle-ai state untouched) (route: delegated writer after one
  mapping of where each of those writes lands)
- [ ] T3 Candidate tasks: long-horizon, multi-file fixtures with hidden graders, each grader
  proven by a reference solution that scores 1 and the untouched fixture that scores below it
  (route: delegated writer)
- [ ] T4 Headroom screen: minimal at `medium`, 3 trials per candidate; keep the tasks under 0.8
  (route: inline run, results committed)
- [ ] T5 A/B run: both configs at `medium` and `high`, 3 repeats, over the kept tasks (route:
  inline run, results committed)
- [ ] T6 Report and roadmap: `evals/report.mjs` with `--require-complete` and
  `--min-discriminating`, the result written to the roadmap (route: delegated writer for the
  report, inline for the roadmap)

## Progress
- 2026-09-30: F5 opened. Spend decision taken: no USD ceiling. The predecessor's runner and its
  "0 of 32" were mapped (`D:\harness\bin\eval.mjs`, `PLAN.md:661`); the cause was ceiling, not
  noise alone.

## Next step
T1, the runner against a fake agent command.
